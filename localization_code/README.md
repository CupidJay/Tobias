## Random CNN's Localization ability

We provide SCDA (as well as CAM) code on CUB200 and ImageNet. We think the code is easy to follow and you just need to change the corresponding lines if you want to try different settings, e.g., activation functions, initialization method and initialization weight.

*Note*: You need to set the dataset path in your environment in these files.

### Instruction

   ```
   python CUB_SCDA.py
